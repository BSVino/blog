Title: Haesemeyer's Law
Time: 1454082966

I just graduated a short time ago from the UCLA math program, and while I was there I met Dr. Christian Haesemeyer. When he introduced himself to me, I asked, "What sort of math do you do?" and his response was, jokingly, "Abstract algebra. In other words, nothing that can be used to build a bomb."

Two thousand years ago Euclid could have said the same thing as he was developing the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. At the time he was doing work which was so obscure and irrelevant to the problems of his day that it may never have entered his mind that it could ever be used to commit an act of violence. And yes, it took more than two thousand years, but today we have smart bombs that use FTA to encrypt their communications. In fact, FTA is the basis of most common methods of crypography.

There are lots of examples of abstract or theoretical fields finding practical uses. Group theory was once a toy for mathematicians to cut their teeth on, thought to have no useful applications. Today, Wikipedia tells me, it is used to model quantum behavior of particles and the formation of crystals. When Dirac predicted the existence of positrons he told a journalist that the physics he was developing had absolutely no application whatsoever. Not two decades later, his work turned out to be a major contributor to producing the atomic bomb (although he personally was not involved.)

Dr. Haesemeyer is working on much more advanced topics than FTA, but I'm sure that some day in the future, someone somewhere will use the results of his field to build a bomb. It may take another two thousand years, but arguing that his work is too abstract to be useful is a failure of imagination.

It's disappointing to hear the phrase "impractical scientific research". It entirely misses the point of scientific research. Scientists aren't there to discover what may be possible a year from now, or even within our lifetimes. Private corporations will solve these problems in the inexorable persuit of profit. Academics take a longer view. What problems will our society have a hundred years from now? They will be big problems, and we'll need a head start, but there's no incentive to work on them now. We need people who can see them and work on them today. Those people will be misunderstood and underappreciated, but when the time comes to face those problems, we'll be glad that somebody was thinking about them ahead of time.

In the 1940's, when profit-driven oil drilling was increasing exponentially, we needed [M. King Hubbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._King_Hubbert) to think about what will happen in 2040, once we've exhausted all of the underground oil. Good thing he did, and now we're investing in renewable sources of energy. [Girolamo Fracastoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girolamo_Fracastoro) was the first to suggest that diseases could be transferred by touch. He said that in the 15th century, and it took until the 19th century for everyone to start washing their hands. [Charles Babbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage) and [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace) designed algorithms for their [theoretical computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine) in the 1840s. A hundred years later when the [ENIAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC) was built, the algorithms were ready to go.

Sometimes I mention that I'm currently reading a book on category theory, or enumerative combinatorics, or whatever seems interesting at the moment, and I often get asked, "What is the application of this?" The short and socially palatable answer is that it's fun and I enjoy stretching my brain to work in a different way. But there's a deeper reason that's too subtle to relate in conversation - that I'm not concerned about the application of something, because applications tend to present themselves eventually. So I would like to coin a new rule, with apologies to Dr. Haesemeyer.

**Haesemeyer's Law**: _Any mathematical result, no matter how abstract, will eventually be used to build a bomb._

If you replace "mathematical" with "scientific" and "to build a bomb" with "in some application" then you can see the longer view of why people study obscure topics with no apparent relevance.
